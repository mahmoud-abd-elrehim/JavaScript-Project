                            Ive was born in Chingford, London, United Kingdom.
                            His father was a silversmith who lectured at Middlesex Polytechnic.
                            "He's a fantastic craftsman, his Christmas gift to me would be one day of his time in his college workshop,
                            during the Christmas break when no one else was there, helping me make whatever I dreamed up".
                            Ive attended the Chingford Foundation School, then Walton High School in Stafford.
                            During his high school years, Ive was passionate about cars and it was this interest that led to his later career as a designer.
                            Following graduation from Walton, Ive explored the option of studying car design in London,
                            such as the course offered at the Royal College of Art;
                            however, he encountered a learning environment that was off-putting:
                            "The classes were full of students making vroom! vroom! noises as they drew".

                            After a year with Roberts Weaver, Ive joined a London startup design agency called Tangerine,
                            located in Hoxton Square where he designed a diverse array of products, such as microwave ovens and toothbrushes.
                            However, his frustration with the position reached a turning point after he designed a toilet,
                            bidet and sink for client Ideal Standard, and the company's boss rejected Ive's work, 
                            stating that the products were too costly and looked too modern.
                            Ive was unhappy working for clients whom he disliked and who didn't possess the same principles.
                            Apple was a Tangerine client that Ive appreciated and he had been acting in a consultancy role for the computer firm while at Tangerine,
                            creating the initial PowerBook designs.
                            Apple had actually been attempting to recruit him as a full-time employee for two years without success

                           It was while working for design agency Tangerine that Ive first encountered Apple,
                           who was a client of the company at the time. Ive helped to create the Powerbook laptops (pictured the Apple PowerBook 520 laptop computer),
                           and joined Apple as a full-time designer in 1992.
                           Ive has designed products for charitable causes,
                           including a Leica camera for a charity auction that set a world record auction price for a camera
                           and a Jaeger-LeCoultre sports watch only one of three in the world for an AIDS-charity auction
