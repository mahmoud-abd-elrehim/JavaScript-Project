                        recent months, Sir Jonathan Ive, the forty-seven-year-old senior vice-president of design at Apple who used to play rugby in secondary school, and still has a bench-pressing bulk that he carries a little sheepishly, as if it belonged to someone else has described himself as both deeply, deeply tired and always anxious. When he sits down, on an aluminum stool in Apple  design studio, or in the cream leather back seat of his Bentley Mulsanne, a car for a head of state, he is likely to emit a soft, half-ironic groan. His manner suggests the burden of being fully appreciated. 
                        here were times, during the past two decades, when he considered leaving Apple, but he stayed, becoming an intimate friend of Steve Jobs and establishing

                        It looks clunky, even clumsy compared to the more evolved versions that followed. But when the first iPod was launched at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California on 23 October 2001, it was revolutionary. "This is a major breakthrough," Apple boss Steve Jobs said, gazing into the future. And set against the digital music players then on the market, the iPod was a revelation. The others were fiddly, trivial-looking plastic things cluttered with buttons and dials, appealing mainly to gadget-obsessed geeks with the time to figure out how to work them. In contrast, the iPod was a sleek digital jukebox that fitted snugly in the palm of your hand; it could hold one thousand songs

                        Sir Jonathan Ive was born in London in 1967, and studied industrial design at Newcastle Polytechnic, now known as Northumbria University
                        It was while working for design agency Tangerine that Ive first encountered Apple, who was a client of the company at the time. Ive helped to create the Powerbook laptops (pictured the Apple PowerBook 520 laptop computer), and joined Apple as a full-time designer in 1992.
                        The iMac is generally credited for being the product which helped to turn Apple fortunes around. Available in 13 different colours, it was launched shortly after Jobs' return to Apple. Jobs appointed Ive as Senior Vice President of Industrial Design in 1997.
